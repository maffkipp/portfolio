    details: "This project was built using primarily React and Contentful CMS. This combination allowed me full control over the layout while still affording the client all the benefits of a modern CMS. I looked to Material Design for inspiration for the layout, colors, and fonts; I also used react-images for the photo lightbox and moment.js for date parsing."
